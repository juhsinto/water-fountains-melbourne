# Water Fountains Melbourne

### This application makes use of Angular components - I've split the sections of the application into logical groupings - the main core into 'todo-components', where most of the application logic resides.

### This application uses FireBase for the database backend.

### This application makes use of concepts such as Inputs (data passing between components), routing - where different sections (pages) of the app are separated, expressions, pipes, and forms.
